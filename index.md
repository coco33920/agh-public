## French

# TeX to HTML Translation
The HTML files are directly generated from the TeX file via a little script of my own, you can download and see it on the 
repository [here](https://github.com/coco33920/agh-public/generate-web.py) the usage is simple just 
put the python file on the same place as the `agh.tex` file and use it like that 

## Usage
You need to create a `web`Â folder as I did not created the
```bash
./generate-web.py 
```

If you have the french version under a directory named french you can also build it with 
```bash
./generate-web.py --which french
```

You can build a certain chapter with (the chapter 0 is the prologue so the numbering follows the PDF)
```bash
./generate-web.py --chapter number
```

And you can mix and match
```bash
./generate-web.py --which file --chapter number
```
to build a certain chapter from a file
